# DEV_LOG

Purpose: curated handoff state for agents and developers. This is not a raw transcript. Keep it short, factual, and useful after context loss.

## Current Handoff

- Branch: `feature/rust-rewrite`
- Goal: Rust rewrite of Alive per `ROADMAP.md`, milestone by milestone.
- Current status: **M0 (Bootstrap) complete.** Workspace + `alive-core` build and test green.
- Next action: **Start M1 — scan engine foundation** (`config`, `template`, `engine`, `protocols/http`, `bin/alive`). See `ROADMAP.md`.
- Blockers: none.
- Relevant files: `Cargo.toml`, `crates/core/src/*`, `ROADMAP.md`, `WORKSPACE_SPEC.md`.
- Relevant docs: `ROADMAP.md` (plan), `map.md`, `WORKSPACE_SPEC.md`, `GIT_FLOW.md`.
- Last test command: `cargo test -p alive-core`
- Last test result: 6 passed, 0 failed.
- Docs sync: roadmap + workspace spec + core specs written.

## Recent Sessions

### 2026-07-06 — M0 Bootstrap

#### Summary
- Initialized the Rust rewrite: Cargo workspace + `alive-core` crate + doc workflow + `ROADMAP.md`.

#### Changed
- Added `Cargo.toml` (workspace), `crates/core` with `Target`/`Finding`/`Severity`/`Protocol`/`Error`.
- Added `.gitignore`; gitignored the old Go `alive` binary and `Alive_release/`.
- Scaffolded doc workflow (map/specs/git-flow/dev-log); wrote `ROADMAP.md` + filled `WORKSPACE_SPEC.md`.

#### Decisions
- Locked design decisions recorded in `ROADMAP.md` (nuclei-compatible YAML, all-in-one,
  fingerprint-first, switchable AI provider, gRPC stream push, decentralized peer-elected mesh,
  scoped-command safety model). Full picture in `WORKSPACE_SPEC.md`.
- Old Go sources left in place for now; superseded by the rewrite, cleaned up later.

#### Failed Attempts
- None.

#### Next Steps
- M1: scan engine foundation. Start with `config` + `template` (nuclei YAML model).

## Log Hygiene

- Keep `Current Handoff` current and concise.
- Add one `Recent Sessions` entry per meaningful task/session.
- Record failed attempts only when they prevent repeated mistakes.
- Move old entries to `devlogs/YYYY-MM.md` if this file becomes too long.
